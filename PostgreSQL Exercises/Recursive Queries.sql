--Queries based on exercises from PostgreSQL Exercises (https://pgexercises.com/questions/recursive/)

/*
Common Table Expressions allow us to, effectively, create our own temporary tables for the duration of a query - 
they're largely a convenience to help us make more readable SQL. 
Using the WITH RECURSIVE modifier, however, it's possible for us to create recursive queries. 
This is enormously advantageous for working with tree and graph-structured data - 
imagine retrieving all of the relations of a graph node to a given depth, for example.
